## What is TAS?

- VMware Tanzu Application Service for VMs (TAS for VMs) is based on Cloud Foundry, which is an open-source cloud app platform, providing a choice of clouds, 
  developer frameworks, and app services. TAS for VMs makes it faster and easier to build, test, deploy, and scale apps. 
  It is an open-source project and is available through a variety of private cloud distributions and public cloud instances. 

- TAS for VMs components include a self-service application execution engine, an automation engine for application deployment and lifecycle management, 
  and a scriptable command line interface (CLI), as well as integration with development tools to ease deployment processes. 
  TAS for VMs has an open architecture that includes a buildpack mechanism for adding frameworks, an application services interface, 
  and a cloud provider interface.
